          <p>While Valorant share many similarities with games such as Counter Strike, Overwatch, and Rainbow 6 Siege most of those similarities aren't shared across all of these games. </p>
          <br>
          <p>For those that worry that Valorant will completely annnihilate the competition, or those who think Valorant will fail as it's just another FPS copycat of CS:GO, they need to understand that there is a bit more to it. What makes Valorant it own separate entity is how it combines certain aspects of FPS in a new format that can be fun in its own right.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Below is a quick analysis on similar games that may seem like "carbon copies" but when better observed, can be understood to have their own core aspects that make them shine in their respective niches.</p>

          <p>Counter Strike is a game that has a decent amount of stress on the gunplay, as being able to shoot an enemy before they shoot you will always come in handy, but the game also has some importance on utility. </p>
          <br>
          <p>A lot of things that you normally wouldn't worry about in games like Overwatch or R6 become important, such as knowing where to place your smoke grenades, knowing when to save your items for the next round, and being able to discern which guns you should buy based on your skill, strategy, and economy.</p>

        <div class="textContainer">
          <p>Overwatch is a character-based shooter that has a heavy emphasis on working as a group. Teams of players must work together to defend or capture objectives on the map, making use of their abilities and team composition.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While gunplay is always important in a shooter, it's more important to cooperate with your team and synchronize your abilities to make big plays and close out the game. Team composition becomes more important than ever as having no tank to block the oncoming barrage of bullets could make it impossible to push forward while not having a support could lead to your team getting wiped by an ultimate ability.</p>

        <div class="textContainer">
          <p>Rainbow Six Siege is also a character-based shooter, not unalike Overwatch and Valorant. However R6 operators differ from the guns and gadjets they can use, and the players that are familiar with CS:GO and Overwatch will not have an easy transition into this game, as there are many mechanics that become way more important in R6 than in any other game.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While information on the enemy is important in games like CS:GO and Overwatch, R6 truly shines on this aspect of the game as players can access cameras, drones, and other gadjets to collect as much information as they can before making their next moves. Gunplay is immensly important as all headshots from any gun will instantly kill you, so it becomes much more important to understand the locations of the enemies and the layout of the map.</p>

        <div class="textContainer">
          <p>Valorant shares aspects with many of these games and incorporates them into a new game. It focuses on gunplay and makes sure that abilities aren't too overpowered that they undermine the gunplay while still allowing players to use their creativity to combine the use of abilities and shooting to pull of satisfying plays that can rival other games.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The best part of the discussion on whether Valorant is "good or bad" or whether it's "just another FPS game" is that it can be easily settled once it releases as the game will be free to play. Skeptical players can find out for themselves and those really unsure will have no trouble finding videos and streams online that will definitely put Valorant to the test.</p>
